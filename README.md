ðŸŒŸ Reuben Mwikya's Portfolio - README
Overview
Hey there! This is my personal portfolio website that I built from scratch using just HTML and CSS. It's where I showcase my journey into web development, the projects I'm proud of, and how to get in touch with me.

Key Features
Clean & Responsive: Looks good on phones, tablets, and desktops

Quick Navigation: Easy to find what you're looking for

Project Showcase: See what I've been working on

Contact Form: Drop me a message (UI only - needs backend to work fully)

Tech Stack
Just the essentials:

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for styling

Netlify for hosting
